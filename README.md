## My process and what I've learned

I created an XD File before coding to create a prototype of the design [qr-code-component.xd](https://xd.adobe.com/view/dba42128-ab88-4ebc-b562-51fb63f8c2aa-8ef7/)

I also drew the containers for each element on the page to provide a visualization of how everything is structured before I code. You can see this below:




### Built with

- HTML and CSS
- BEM CSS class naming convention
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to use these lines of code. Vew snippets below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```


### Continued development

In the future, I want to be able to work faster and create nav bars with fluidly using flexbow.
