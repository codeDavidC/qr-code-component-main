## My process and what I learned

I created an XD File before coding to create a prototype of the design. I also drew the containers for each element on the page to provide a visualization of how everything is structured before I code.


### Built with

- HTML and CSS
- BEM CSS class naming convention
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to use these lines of code. Vew snippets below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```


### Continued development and resources

In the future, I want to be able to work faster and create nav bars with fluidly using flexbow.
